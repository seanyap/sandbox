# Sandbox

This is where I place all my mini-projects to practice my front-end skills

- [Ghibli](https://seanyap.github.io/sandbox/ghibli) - Studio Ghibli web app for learning how to connect to an API
- [Expanding Cards](https://seanyap.github.io/sandbox/expanding-cards) - Expanding Cards app to play with event listeners
